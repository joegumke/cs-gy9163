# cs-gy9163 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joegumke/cs-gy9163.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joegumke/cs-gy9163)

Welcome to the CS-GY 9163 README Page. This is for Fall2019 NYU course CS-GY 9163 from Professor Gallagher. 
The intent is to publish a spell checker application based in C.

There are 3 main functions : 

What the spell checker does is take two inputs (1 - dictionary, and 2 - list of words), and the spell checker makes a hash table of the dictionary provided by input 1. The hash table is built by processing the word to be stored in the dictionary and runs the hash function against this to build an index for the hash table. The hash table will be a list of linked nodes which could be linked lists if there are words that have the same index. 

***Function Load Dictionary Explanation:***
Load dictionary function is used to load the word list provided by the user and instantiate a linked node list that uses the hashed value of the dictionary word as an index as a pointer in the list. The list could be linked list if there are multiple matches of said hash. This function must be loaded first to the build the dictionary and compare the words against. I take the wordlist provided from input, and lower case all the words for consistency, along with stripping newline delimiters with a null delimiter (‘0’). To secure this function, I check for input validation to a certain extent by checking if a file exists, if not return 0 and quit. You could validate this further by ensuring that this is a certain file type. Malloc is used in this function to dynamically allocate memory of node added to the linked node list as the size of the nodes may vary based on input. This function returns true or false.

***Function Check Word Low Level Detail:***
Check Word is the function that processes whether a word input is valid by comparing into the dictionary/word list that is also provided (argument 2). It takes the word input, lower cases the value, hashes this value, and iterates through the node list (processed dictionary) to see if there is a hash value match. For security, I ensure that there is proper input validation by ensuring that the function does not process if the word input, hashtable, input is NULL, or length of the word is length is less than maximum allowed value (45 characters). This function returns true or false.

***Function Check_Words Low Level Detail:***
Check words takes the input of a file and processes that into individual words that then calls the check_word function for validation if there is a match against the dictionary. This function keeps a count of the misspelled words and returns this to the user. We also keep the misspelled words into an array. For security, I keep a limit of the misspelled words array to 1,000 entries. I take the input and use string tokenization by delimiting the words on a line by spaces, and process that value. For further input validation, I also check if the word stripped out from the line if less than the length of the allowed word value (45 characters), if not do not further processing. I also ensure input validation by ensuring that the user inputs a file, otherwise quit. Punctuation stripping also occurs here by removing punctuation before and after the word, that might occur from run-on sentences or misspellings from the input. Malloc is used in this function for dynamic memory allocation when adding words to the misspelled array as the length of words may vary.
